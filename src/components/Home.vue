                          SEO is always at the top of any digital marketing
                          agency services list. That’s because it affects all
                          your online marketing strategies. SEO is vital to
                          ensure your website shows up in online searches.
                          Without effective SEO, prospective customers may never
                          get to see any of your digital marketing efforts.
                          That’s because search engines have the power to choose
                          which websites appear when people conduct online
                          searches.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          They decide this based on complex algorithms that
                          weigh up numerous criteria to determine if your
                          website is what the searcher is looking for. In simple
                          terms, SEO means optimizing all your online content so
                          that’s it’s easily discoverable by these search
                          engines. For example, if you’re selling socks, you
                          want the search engines to present your website first
                          when people type ‘’socks’’ into their search bar. It
                          makes sense that thousands of websites would have a
                          term like ‘socks’ associated with them. That’s why
                          it’s important to use the services of a digital
                          marketing agency to help you stand out amongst the
                          competition.
